/**
 * `pnpm batch`: several approved pull requests landed on one verify
 * (yggi/music-commons#68). Landing one at a time, every merge moves `main`
 * and each pull request still open is verified again; a batch is verified
 * once, as the tree `main` will have when all of it has landed.
 *
 *   pnpm batch prepare <pr>...   a worktree at origin/main with each head merged in, in the order given
 *   pnpm batch check <tree>      whether origin/main has that tree, once the batch is squashed in
 *
 * `prepare` merges each head as GitHub's squash will, one after another. A
 * head that conflicts with `main` and the heads before it is left out and
 * named: it takes `main` once the batch has landed, the usual way. It prints
 * the worktree and its tree; `pnpm verify` there (and `pnpm test:slow`,
 * `pnpm e2e` where a pull request reaches them) stands for every pull request
 * merged in. `check` exits 0 when `origin/main` has that tree, and 1 when it
 * differs, which says something else landed between: verify `main` then.
 * A batch is at most `MOST` pull requests.
